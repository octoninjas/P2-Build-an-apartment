# P2-Build-an-apartment
Hello, my name is Carlos Mendes and this is the 2nd project for the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) virtual reality nanodegree.
The app is a virtual apartment that you can visit clicking on your device. All the objects are static except for the Globe that spins 360ยบ when you click.


It took me around 4 hours to complete it and the greatest chalenge was to create baked lights since it was generating lots of artifacts.

It took quit a bit of tweeking, so i hope you like it.


In the builds folder you can  download the apk and install it in you Android device. 
Just be sure to get a [google cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/) for the full and intended experience.


You can also get the full project and open it on [Unity 3D](https://unity3d.com/pt) for a ride. Have fun!
